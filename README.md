# YOLOv8-car_plate_Detection
Useing yolov8 for License plate target frame detection

Here are my steps:
### Step 1: Install necessary libraries
Before starting training, you need to install the `ultralytics` library, which contains all the functions of YOLOv8. You can use the following command to install it:
```bash
pip install ultralytics
```
### Step 2: Prepare the dataset
The dataset is the basis for training the model. For the license plate detection task, you need to prepare an image dataset containing license plates and annotate the license plates. The annotation format is usually the YOLO format, that is, each annotation file is a `.txt` file, each line represents a target, and the format is `category number x_center y_center width height`, where the coordinates and sizes are proportional values ​​relative to the width and height of the image.

The directory structure of the dataset is usually as follows:
```
dataset/
├── images/
│ ├── train/
│ │ ├── image1.jpg
│ │ ├── image2.jpg
│ │ └── ...
│ └── val/
│ ├── image3.jpg
│ ├── image4.jpg
│ └── ...
└── labels/
├── train/
│ ├── image1.txt
│ ├── image2.txt
│ └── ...
└── val/
├── image3.txt
├── image4.txt
└── ...
### Step 3: Create a data configuration file
The data configuration file is a `.yaml` file that specifies the path, number of categories, and category names of the dataset. Here is an example `data.yaml` file:
```yaml
train: path/to/dataset/images/train
val: path/to/dataset/images/val

nc: 1 # Number of categories, here is the license plate, so it is 1
names: ['license_plate'] # Category name
```

### Step 4: Select a pre-trained model
YOLOv8 provides a variety of pre-trained models, you can choose the right model according to your needs. Common pre-trained models include `yolov8n.pt` (small model, fast speed), `yolov8s.pt` (medium model, balance speed and accuracy), `yolov8m.pt` (large model, high accuracy), etc.

### Step 5: Train the model
The `YOLO` class provided by the `ultralytics` library can be used to easily train the model. The following is a training code example:

### Step 6: Evaluate the model
After training, you can use the validation set to evaluate the model and view the model's performance indicators. The following is an evaluation code example:

### Step 7: Use the model for prediction
The trained model can be used to predict new images or videos. The following is a prediction code example:
